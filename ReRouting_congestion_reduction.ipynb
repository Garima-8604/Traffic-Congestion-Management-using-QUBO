        "Cities often face traffic congestion during major urban events such as concerts, sports games, festivals, or political gatherings. These events lead to sudden increases in traffic volume, which traditional traffic management systems struggle to handle. Unmanaged congestion can result in longer travel times, increased carbon emissions, public dissatisfaction, and challenges for emergency vehicles trying to navigate crowded streets.\n",
